Merchant is a simple payment abstraction library used in and sponsored by Shopify. It is written by Tobias Luetke, Cody Fauser, and contributors. The aim of the project is to feel natural to Ruby users and to abstract as many parts as possible away from the user to offer a consistent interface across all supported gateways.","fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/downloads","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/issues{/number}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/pulls{/number}","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/notifications{?since,all,participating}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/labels{/name}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/releases{/id}","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zeno/active_merchant/deployments"},{"id":72819,"name":"scriptaculous","full_name":"mrosorani/scriptaculous","owner":{"login":"mrosorani","id":27241,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27241?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani","html_url":"https://github.com/mrosorani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrosorani/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/mrosorani/scriptaculous","description":"script.aculo.us
